This is my tool for rice.

## Usage

You should clone this repo and write your config at `~/.config/chopsticks/repo/`.

for example, you can write `~/.config/chopsticks/repo/example/pkg.py` as follow:

```python
from core.package import Package
from core.action import RunCommand

pkg = Package(
    name="example",
    version="1.28.0",
    dependencies=[],
    install=[RunCommand("echo install example"), RunCommand("echo Hello World!")],
    uninstall=[RunCommand("echo uninstall example")],
    update=[RunCommand("echo update example")],
)

```

And `~/.config/chopsticks/repo/example1/pkg.py` as follow:

```python
from core.package import Package
from core.action import RunCommand

pkg = Package(
    name="example1",
    version="1.11.0",
    dependencies=["example"],
    install=[RunCommand("echo install example1"), RunCommand("echo Hello World!")],
    uninstall=[RunCommand("echo uninstall example1")],
    update=[RunCommand("echo update example1")],
)
```

Then go to the directory you clone the repo, and run:

```bash
python -m chopsticks install example1
```

You can also run uninstall and update command.

And you can use `--dry-run` flag to see what will be done without actually doing it.

You can manage your config as a git repo and clone it to the `~/.config/chopsticks/repo/` on a new machine to quickly set up your environment.
